This is a test document for the LangChain chunking functionality.

It contains multiple paragraphs and sentences to test the text splitting algorithm.

The document processing pipeline should:
1. Read the file content
2. Split it into chunks based on the specified chunk size
3. Apply overlap between chunks for better context preservation
4. Generate embeddings for each chunk using the Polish BERT model
5. Store the vectors in the Qdrant database with appropriate metadata

This is the end of the test document.
